\chapter{Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms}

\section{Introduction}

Data structures and algorithms are one of the fundamental components of computer
science. They are essential for solving complex problems efficiently and
effectively. Data structures are used to store and organize data in a computer
so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. Algorithms
are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem. They are the
instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

In this course, we will learn about the fundamental data structures and
algorithms that are used in computers. We will study how to design,
implement, and analyze data structures and algorithms to solve real-world
problems. By the end of this course, you will have a solid foundation in
data structures and algorithms that will help you become a better programmer
and problem solver.

\section{Setup and Installation}

In this course, we will be using the C++ programming language to implement
data structures and algorithms. C++ is a powerful and versatile programming
language that is widely used in the field of computer science. To get started,
you will need to install a C++ compiler and an integrated development
environment (IDE) on your computer.

\subsection{C++ Compiler Installation}

The first step is to install a C++ compiler on your computer. A compiler is
a program that translates source code written in a programming language into
machine code that can be executed by a computer. There are several C++
compilers available, but we recommend using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
which is a free and open-source compiler that supports multiple programming
languages including C++.

\subsubsection{Windows}

To install GCC on Windows, you can use the MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows)
project which provides a port of GCC to Windows. You can download the MinGW
installer from the MinGW website and follow the installation instructions.
You can install MinGW by following the instructions here:
\url{https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp#_example-install-mingwx64-on-windows}

\subsection{Visual Studio Code Installation}

The next step is to install an integrated development environment (IDE) on
your computer. An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive
facilities to computer programmers for software development. We recommend
using Visual Studio Code which is a free and open-source IDE developed by
Microsoft. You can download Visual Studio Code from the official website
and follow the installation instructions: \url{https://code.visualstudio.com/Download}

Other than Visual Studio Code, you also need to install the C/C++ extension
for Visual Studio Code. You can install the C/C++ extension by following the
instructions here: \url{https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp}

\subsection{Testing the Installation}

To test if the installation was successful, you can create a simple C++
program and compile it using the C++ compiler. Open Visual Studio Code and
create a new file with the following C++ code:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Hello World Program}]
#include <iostream>
namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Save the file with a .cpp extension (e.g., hello.cpp) and open a terminal
window in Visual Studio Code. Compile the program using the following command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption={Compiling the Program}]
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
\end{lstlisting}

If there are no errors, you can run the program by executing the following
command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption={Running the Program}]
./hello
\end{lstlisting}

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the output "Hello, World!"
printed on the screen.

\section{What are Data Structures?}

A \textbf{\textit{data structure}} is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so
that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. Data structures provide a
way to manage large amounts of data effectively for various applications. They
define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be
performed on the data. There are many different types of data structures that
are used in computer science, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The use
of the right data structure can significantly improve the performance of an
algorithm and make it more efficient.

\section{What are Algorithms?}

An \textbf{\textit{algorithm}} is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem.
It is a sequence of well-defined instructions that take some input and produce
an output. Algorithms are used to solve complex problems and perform various
tasks efficiently. They are the instructions that tell a computer how to perform
a task. Algorithms are essential for writing computer programs and developing
software applications. The efficiency of an algorithm is measured by its time
complexity and space complexity.

\section{Why Study Data Structures and Algorithms?}

Data structures and algorithms are essential topics in computer science and
software engineering. They are one of the fundamental components of computer
science and are used in various applications such as operating systems,
database management systems, networking, artificial intelligence, and many
others. A good understanding of data structures and algorithms will help
you become a better programmer and problem solver. In addition, many companies
use data structures and algorithms as part of their technical interviews to
assess the problem-solving skills of candidates. Therefore, studying data
structures and algorithms is essential for anyone pursuing a career in
software engineering or software development.

\section{Basic Terminologies}

Before we dive into the details of data structures and algorithms, let's
understand some basic terminologies that might be helpful in understanding
the concepts better.

\subsection{Data}

\textbf{\textit{Data}} is a collection of facts, figures, or information that
can be used for analysis or reference. It can be in the form of numbers, text,
images, audio, video, or any other format. Data is the raw material that is
processed by a computer to produce meaningful information.

\subsection{Data Object}

A \textbf{\textit{data object}} is an instance of a data structure that contains
data along with the operations that can be performed on the data. It is an
abstraction of a real-world entity that is represented in a computer program.

\subsection{Data Type}

A \textbf{\textit{data type}} is a classification of data that tells the compiler
or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. It defines the
operations that can be performed on the data, the values that can be stored
in the data, and the memory space required to store the data.

\subsubsection{Primitive Data Types}

Primitive data types are the basic data types that are built into the programming
language. They are used to store simple values such as integers, floating-point
numbers, characters, and booleans. Examples of primitive data types include
int, float, char, and bool. The following are the common primitive data types
used in programming:

\paragraph{Integer (int)}

The \textbf{\textit{integer}} data type is used to store whole numbers without any decimal points.
It can be either signed or unsigned, depending on whether it can store negative
values or not. An integer's value can range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
and takes 4 bytes of memory.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Integer Data Type}]
int x = 10;
\end{lstlisting}


\paragraph{Character (char)}

The \textbf{\textit{character}} data type is used to store a single character such as a letter,
digit, or special symbol. It is represented by a single byte of memory. A char
value can range from -128 to 127 or 0 to 255, depending on whether it is signed
or unsigned. These values are represented using ASCII codes.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Character Data Type}]
char c = 'A';
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Boolean (bool)}

The \textbf{\textit{boolean}} data type is used to store true or false values. It is represented
by a single byte of memory. A bool value can be either true or false.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Boolean Data Type}]
bool flag = true;
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Floating-Point (float)}

The \textbf{\textit{floating-point}} data type is used to store real numbers with decimal points.
It can represent both integer and fractional parts of a number. It can be either
single precision or double precision, depending on the number of bits used to
store the value. A float value can range from 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38 and takes 4
bytes of memory.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Floating-Point Data Type}]
float y = 3.14;
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Double (double)}

The \textbf{\textit{double}} data type is used to store real numbers with double precision. It can
represent both integer and fractional parts of a number with higher precision
than the float data type. A double value can range from 2.3E-308 to 1.7E+308 and
takes 8 bytes of memory.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Double Data Type}]
double z = 3.14159;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Non-primitive Data Types}

Non-primitive data types are more complex data types that are derived from primitive
data types. They are used to store collections of values or objects. Examples of
non-primitive data types include arrays, strings, structures, classes, and pointers.

\paragraph{Array (int, float, char, etc.)}

An \textbf{\textit{array}} is a collection of elements of the same data type that are stored in
contiguous memory locations. It is used to store multiple values of the same
type under a single name. The elements of an array can be accessed using an
index value. In C++, arrays are zero-indexed, which means the first element is
at index 0. Arrays also have a fixed size that is specified at the time of
declaration. If you need a dynamic size array, you can use a vector in C++.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Array Data Type}]
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{String (char)}

A \textbf{\textit{string}} is a collection of characters that are stored
as a sequence of characters terminated by a null character
'\textbackslash0'. It is used to represent text in a computer program.
Strings are treated as arrays of characters in C++.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={String Data Type}]
char str[] = "Hello, World!";
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Structure}

A \textbf{\textit{structure}} is a user-defined data type that is used to
store a collection of different data types under a single name. It is used
to represent a record that contains multiple fields or members. Each field
in a structure can have a different data type.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Structure Data Type}]
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float height;
};
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Class}

A \textbf{\textit{class}} is a user-defined data type that is used to define
objects that contain data members and member functions. It is used to
implement object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation,
inheritance, and polymorphism.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Class Data Type}]
class Circle {
    private:
        float radius;
    public:
        float getArea() {
            return 3.14 * radius * radius;
        }
};
\end{lstlisting}

% \paragraph{Pointer}

% A \textbf{\textit{pointer}} is a special type of data type that stores the
% memory address of another data type. It is used to store the address of a
% variable or object in memory. Pointers are used to implement dynamic
% memory allocation and to pass parameters by reference.

% \begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Pointer Data Type}]
% int x = 10;
% int *ptr = &x;

% cout << *ptr; // Output: 10
% \end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Vector}

A \textbf{\textit{vector}} is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size
dynamically. It is a part of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ and
provides a more flexible alternative to fixed-size arrays. Vectors are used
to store a collection of elements of the same data type.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Vector Data Type}]
vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{List}

A \textbf{\textit{list}} is a linear data structure that is used to store a
collection of elements in a sequential order. It is a part of the Standard
Template Library (STL) in C++ and provides operations to insert, delete, and
access elements in the list. Lists are used to implement linked lists in C++.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={List Data Type}]
list<int> lst = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
\end{lstlisting}

There are different types of lists in C++, such as singly linked list, doubly
linked list, circular linked list, and circular doubly linked list, that provide different operations and
performance characteristics.

\subparagraph{Singly Linked List}

A \textbf{\textit{singly linked list}} is a linear data structure that is used
to store a collection of elements in a sequential order. Each element in the
list is stored in a node that contains the data and a pointer to the next node
in the list.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Singly Linked List Data Type}]
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *next;
};
\end{lstlisting}

\subparagraph{Doubly Linked List}

A \textbf{\textit{doubly linked list}} is a linear data structure that is used
to store a collection of elements in a sequential order. Each element in the
list is stored in a node that contains the data, a pointer to the next node,
and a pointer to the previous node in the list.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Doubly Linked List Data Type}]
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *next;
    Node *prev;
};
\end{lstlisting}

\subparagraph{Circular Linked List}

A \textbf{\textit{circular linked list}} is a linear data structure that is used
to store a collection of elements in a circular order. Each element in the list
is stored in a node that contains the data and a pointer to the next node in
the list. The last node in the list points back to the first node, creating a
circular structure.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Circular Linked List Data Type}]
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *next;
};
\end{lstlisting}

\subparagraph{Circular Doubly Linked List}

A \textbf{\textit{circular doubly linked list}} is a linear data structure that
is used to store a collection of elements in a circular order. Each element in
the list is stored in a node that contains the data, a pointer to the next node,
and a pointer to the previous node in the list. The last node in the list points
back to the first node, creating a circular structure.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Circular Doubly Linked List Data Type}]
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *next;
    Node *prev;
};
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Stack}

A \textbf{\textit{stack}} is a linear data structure that follows the Last In
First Out (LIFO) principle. It is used to store a collection of elements in a
sequential order. The main operations on a stack are push (to insert an element)
and pop (to remove an element).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Stack Data Type}]
stack<int> stk;
stk.push(1);
stk.push(2);
stk.push(3);
stk.push(4);
stk.pop();
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Queue}

A \textbf{\textit{queue}} is a linear data structure that follows the First In
First Out (FIFO) principle. It is used to store a collection of elements in a
sequential order. The main operations on a queue are enqueue (to insert an
element) and dequeue (to remove an element).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Queue Data Type}]
queue<int> que;
que.push(1);
que.push(2);
que.push(3);
que.push(4);
que.pop();
\end{lstlisting}

There are different types of queues in C++, such as linear queue, circular
queue, priority queue, and double-ended queue (deque), that provide different
operations and performance characteristics.

\subparagraph{Circular Queue}

A \textbf{\textit{circular queue}} is a type of queue that uses a circular
structure to store elements. Unlike a linear queue, a circular queue does not
have a fixed front and rear end. Instead, the front and rear ends wrap around
the ends of the queue. This allows the queue to reuse the space freed up by
dequeued elements. In C++, there is no built-in circular queue data type, but
you can implement one using an array and a few pointers.

\subparagraph{Priority Queue}

A \textbf{\textit{priority queue}} is a type of queue that stores elements
based on their priority. The element with the highest priority is dequeued
first. Priority queues are typically implemented using heaps, which are a
type of binary tree data structure.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Priority Queue Data Type}]
priority_queue<int> pq;
pq.push(1);
pq.push(4);
pq.push(2);
pq.push(3);
pq.pop();
\end{lstlisting}

\subparagraph{Double-Ended Queue (Deque)}

A \textbf{\textit{double-ended queue}} or \textbf{\textit{deque}} is a type of
queue that allows elements to be inserted and removed from both ends. It is
a generalization of both stacks and queues and provides more flexibility in
manipulating elements.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Deque Data Type}]
deque<int> dq;
dq.push_front(1);
dq.push_back(2);
dq.push_front(3);
dq.push_back(4);
dq.pop_front();
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Tree}

A \textbf{\textit{tree}} is a non-linear data structure that is used to store
a collection of elements in a hierarchical order. It consists of nodes that
are connected by edges. The topmost node in a tree is called the root node,
and the nodes below it are called child nodes. Trees are used to represent
hierarchical relationships between elements.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Tree Data Type}]
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *left;
    Node *right;
};
\end{lstlisting}

There are different types of trees in computer science, such as binary trees,
binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, and many others, that provide
different operations and performance characteristics.

\paragraph{Graph}

A \textbf{\textit{graph}} is a non-linear data structure that is used to store
a collection of elements and the relationships between them. It consists of
nodes (vertices) that are connected by edges. Graphs are used to represent
networks, social relationships, maps, and many other real-world applications.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Graph Data Type}]
struct Graph {
    int V;
    list<int> *adj;
};
\end{lstlisting}

There are different types of graphs in computer science, such as directed graphs,
undirected graphs, weighted graphs, and many others, each with its own set of
advantages and disadvantages.

Another important thing to note is that ``Every tree is a graph, but not every
graph is a tree.''

\paragraph{Hash Map or Hash Table}

A \textbf{\textit{Hash Map}} is a data structure that is used to store a
collection of key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to map keys to values
and stores them in an array. Hash maps provide fast access to elements and
are used to implement associative arrays, sets, and dictionaries.

There are two ways to implement a hash map in C++: the ordered map using the
map class or using the unordered\_map class.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Ordered Map Data Type}]
map<string, int> mp;
mp["one"] = 1;
mp["two"] = 2;
mp["three"] = 3;
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Unordered Map Data Type}]
unordered_map<string, int> ump;
ump["one"] = 1;
ump["two"] = 2;
ump["three"] = 3;
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Set}

A \textbf{\textit{set}} is a data structure that is used to store a collection
of unique elements. It is used to implement the mathematical set abstraction
and provides operations to insert, delete, and search for elements.

There are two ways to implement a set in C++: the ordered set using the set
class or using the unordered\_set class.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Ordered Set Data Type}]
set<int> st;
st.insert(1);
st.insert(2);
st.insert(3);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Unordered Set Data Type}]
unordered_set<int> ust;
ust.insert(1);
ust.insert(2);
ust.insert(3);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Abstract Data Type}

An \textbf{\textit{abstract data type (ADT)}} is a mathematical model that
defines a set of data values and operations that can be performed on those
values. It is an abstraction of a data structure that specifies the operations
that can be performed on the data without specifying how they are implemented.
\textit{Abstraction} refers to the process of hiding the implementation
details of a data structure and exposing only the essential features. An ADT
is defined by its interface, which includes the data values and operations
that can be performed on those values.

\subsection{Pointers}

A \textbf{\textit{pointer}} is a special type of data type that stores the
memory address of another data type. An ``address'' is a unique number that
identifies a location in memory. The memory address of a variable is the
location in memory where the variable is stored. Pointers are used to store
the address of a variable or object in memory. Pointers are used to implement
dynamic memory allocation and to pass parameters by reference.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node (x) [draw, rectangle] {x = 10};
        \node (ptr) [draw, rectangle, right=of x] {ptr = 0x7fffbf7f1bdc};
        \draw[->] (ptr) -- (x);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Pointer Example}
    \label{fig:pointer-example}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:pointer-example} shows an example of a pointer in C++. The
variable \texttt{x} stores the value 10, and the pointer \texttt{ptr} stores
the memory address of the variable \texttt{x}. The memory address is represented
as a hexadecimal number \texttt{0x7fffbf7f1bdc}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Pointer Data Type}]
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int *ptr = &x;

    cout << *ptr; // Output: 10

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

In the above example, the pointer \texttt{ptr} stores the memory address of
the variable \texttt{x}. The \texttt{*} operator is used to dereference the
pointer and access the value stored at the memory address.

An example of an address of a variable is \texttt{0x7fffbf7f1bdc}. When you
dereference the pointer, you get the value stored at that address.

\subsubsection{Declaring Pointers}

To declare a pointer, you need to specify the data type of the variable or
object it points to. You can declare a pointer using the following syntax:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Declaring Pointers}]
int *ptr;
\end{lstlisting}

In the above example, the pointer \texttt{ptr} is declared to point to an
integer variable. You can also declare a pointer to a structure, class, or
any other data type.

\subsubsection{Initializing Pointers}

To initialize a pointer, you need to assign it the memory address of a variable
or object. You can initialize a pointer using the address-of operator \texttt{\&}.
You can also initialize a pointer to \texttt{NULL} or \texttt{nullptr} to indicate
that it does not point to any memory location.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Initializing Pointers}]
int x = 10;
int *ptr = &x;
\end{lstlisting}

In the above example, the pointer \texttt{ptr} is initialized with the memory
address of the variable \texttt{x}.

\subsubsection{Dereferencing Pointers}

To access the value stored at the memory address pointed to by a pointer, you
need to dereference the pointer using the dereference operator \texttt{*}. The
dereference operator is used to access the value stored at the memory address.

% Create a tikz figure for dereferencing pointers
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node (x) [draw, rectangle] {x = 10};
        \node (ptr) [draw, rectangle, right=of x] {ptr = 0x7fffbf7f1bdc};
        \draw[->] (ptr) -- (x);
        \node (value) [draw, rectangle, below=of ptr] {*ptr = 10};
        \draw[dashed] (value) -- (ptr);
        \draw[->] (value) -- (x);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Dereferencing Pointers}
    \label{fig:dereferencing-pointers}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:dereferencing-pointers} shows an example of dereferencing a
pointer in C++. The pointer \texttt{ptr} points to the variable \texttt{x},
and the dereference operator \texttt{*} is used to access the value stored at
the memory address.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Dereferencing Pointers}]
int x = 10;
int *ptr = &x;

cout << *ptr; // Output: 10

*ptr = 20;

cout << x; // Output: 20

\end{lstlisting}

In the above example, the pointer \texttt{ptr} points to the variable \texttt{x}.
You can use the dereference operator \texttt{*} to access the value stored at
the memory address. You can also use the dereference operator to modify the
value stored at the memory address.

\subsubsection{Pointer Arithmetic}

Pointer arithmetic is a feature of pointers that allows you to perform
arithmetic operations on pointers. You can add or subtract an integer value
from a pointer to move it to a different memory location. Pointer arithmetic
is used to access elements in an array or to iterate over a data structure.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node (arr) [draw, rectangle] {arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]};
        \node (ptr) [draw, rectangle, right=of arr] {ptr = 0x7fffbf7f1bdc};
        \draw[->] (ptr) -- (arr);
        \node (value) [draw, rectangle, below=of ptr] {*(ptr + 1) = 2};
        \draw[dashed] (value) -- (ptr);
        \draw[->] (value) -- (arr);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Pointer Arithmetic}
    \label{fig:pointer-arithmetic}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:pointer-arithmetic} shows an example of pointer arithmetic in C++.
The pointer \texttt{ptr} points to the first element of the array \texttt{arr},
and the pointer arithmetic operation \texttt{*(ptr + 1)} is used to access the
second element of the array.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Pointer Arithmetic}]
int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int *ptr = arr;

    cout << *ptr; // Output: 1
    cout << *(ptr + 1); // Output: 2

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

In the above example, the pointer \texttt{ptr} points to the first element
of the array \texttt{arr}. You can use pointer arithmetic to access the
elements of the array by adding an integer value to the pointer.

\subsubsection{Pointer to Pointer}

A \textbf{\textit{pointer to pointer}} is a special type of pointer that stores
the memory address of another pointer. It is used to store the address of a
pointer variable in memory. Pointer to pointer is used to implement multiple
levels of indirection and to create dynamic data structures such as linked
lists and trees.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node (x) [draw, rectangle] {x = 10};
        \node (ptr) [draw, rectangle, right=of x] {ptr = 0x7fffbf7f1bdc};
        \draw[->] (ptr) -- (x);
        \node (pptr) [draw, rectangle, right=of ptr] {pptr = 0x7fffbf7f1be0};
        \draw[->] (pptr) -- (ptr);
        \node (value) [draw, rectangle, below=of pptr] {**pptr = 10};
        \draw[dashed] (value) -- (pptr);
        \draw[->] (value) -- (x);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Pointer to Pointer}
    \label{fig:pointer-to-pointer}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:pointer-to-pointer} shows an example of a pointer to pointer in C++.
The pointer \texttt{ptr} stores the memory address of the variable \texttt{x},
and the pointer \texttt{pptr} stores the memory address of the pointer \texttt{ptr}.
The double dereference operator \texttt{**} is used to access the value stored at
the memory address.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Pointer to Pointer Data Type}]
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int *ptr = &x;
    int **pptr = &ptr;

    cout << **pptr; // Output: 10

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

In the above example, the pointer \texttt{ptr} stores the memory address of
the variable \texttt{x}, and the pointer \texttt{pptr} stores the memory
address of the pointer \texttt{ptr}. You can use the double dereference
operator \texttt{**} to access the value stored at the memory address.

\section{Asymptotic Notations}

\textbf{\textit{Asymptotic notations}} are mathematical notations used to
describe the limiting behavior of a function as the input size approaches
infinity. They are used to analyze the complexity of algorithms and to
compare the performance of different algorithms. The three most common
asymptotic notations used in computer science are big-O notation, omega
notation, and theta notation.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./assets/images/Asymptotic Notations.png}
  \caption{Asymptotic Notation}
  \floatfoot{Big-O Complexity Analysis Chart from freeCodeCamp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Big-O Notation}

The \textbf{\textit{big-O notation}} is used to describe the upper bound
on the growth rate of an algorithm as the input size approaches infinity.
It provides an upper limit on the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm.
The big-O notation is used to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm in terms
of the number of basic operations it performs.

\subsection{Omega Notation}

The \textbf{\textit{omega notation}} or \textbf{\textit{big-omega notation}}
is used to describe the lower bound on the growth rate of an algorithm as the
input size approaches infinity. It provides a lower limit on the best-case
time complexity of an algorithm. The omega notation is used to analyze the
efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the minimum number of basic operations
it performs.

\subsection{Theta Notation}

The \textbf{\textit{theta notation}} or \textbf{\textit{big-theta notation}}
is used to describe the tight bound on the growth rate of an algorithm as
the input size approaches infinity. It provides an upper and lower limit on
the time complexity of an algorithm. The theta notation is used to analyze
the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the average number of basic
operations it performs.

\subsection{Complexity of an Algorithm}

The \textbf{\textit{complexity of an algorithm}} is a measure of the amount of time and
space required to execute the algorithm as a function of the input size. It is used
to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm and to compare different algorithms for
the same problem. The complexity of an algorithm is usually expressed using big-O
notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm as the
input size increases.

\subsubsection{Time Complexity}

The \textbf{\textit{time complexity}} of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time
required to execute the algorithm as a function of the input size. It is used to
analyze the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the number of basic operations
it performs. The time complexity of an algorithm is usually expressed using big-O
notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm as the
input size increases.

\paragraph{Constant Time Complexity ($O(1)$)}

An algorithm is said to have a \textbf{\textit{constant time complexity}} if the
execution time of the algorithm does not depend on the input size. It means
that the algorithm takes the same amount of time to execute regardless of
the input size. An example of an algorithm with constant time complexity is
accessing an element in an array using its index.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Constant Time Complexity}]
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int x = arr[2]; // Accessing the element at index 2
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Logarithmic Time Complexity ($O(\log n)$)}

An algorithm is said to have a \textbf{\textit{logarithmic time complexity}} if
the execution time of the algorithm grows logarithmically as the input size
increases. An example of an algorithm with logarithmic time complexity is
binary search, where the input size is halved at each step.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Logarithmic Time Complexity}]
int binarySearch(int arr[], int n, int x) {
    int low = 0, high = n - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == x) return mid;
        else if (arr[mid] < x) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Linear Time Complexity ($O(n)$)}

An algorithm is said to have a \textbf{\textit{linear time complexity}} if the
execution time of the algorithm grows linearly as the input size increases.
It means that the algorithm takes a constant amount of time to process each
element in the input. An example of an algorithm with linear time complexity
is traversing an array to find the maximum element.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Linear Time Complexity}]
int findMax(int arr[], int n) {
    int max = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
    }
    return max;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Linearithmic Time Complexity ($O(n \log n)$)}

An algorithm is said to have a \textbf{\textit{linearithmic time complexity}} if
the execution time of the algorithm grows linearithmically as the input size
increases. An example of an algorithm with linearithmic time complexity is
sorting an array using the merge sort algorithm.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Linearithmic Time Complexity}]
void merge(int arr[], int l, int m, int r) {
    // Merge two subarrays of arr[]
    int i, j, k;
    int n1 = m - l + 1;
    int n2 = r - m;
    
    int *L = new int[n1];
    int *R = new int[n2];

    for (i = 0; i < n1; i++) L[i] = arr[l + i];
    for (j = 0; j < n2; j++) R[j] = arr[m + 1 + j];

    i = 0; j = 0; k = l;
    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
        if (L[i] <= R[j]) arr[k++] = L[i++];
        else arr[k++] = R[j++];
    }

    while (i < n1) arr[k++] = L[i++];
    while (j < n2) arr[k++] = R[j++];
}

void mergeSort(int arr[], int l, int r) {
    if (l < r) {
        int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
        mergeSort(arr, l, m);
        mergeSort(arr, m + 1, r);
        merge(arr, l, m, r);
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Quadratic Time Complexity ($O(n^2)$)}

An algorithm is said to have a \textbf{\textit{quadratic time complexity}} if
the execution time of the algorithm grows quadratically as the input size
increases. It means that the time taken by the algorithm to process each
element in the input is proportional to the square of the input size. An
example of an algorithm with quadratic time complexity is the bubble sort
algorithm.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Quadratic Time Complexity}]
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Another common example of an algorithm with quadratic time complexity is
a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of elements in an array.

\paragraph{Exponential Time Complexity ($O(2^n)$)}

An algorithm is said to have an \textbf{\textit{exponential time complexity}} if
the execution time of the algorithm grows exponentially as the input size
increases. It means that the time taken by the algorithm increases
exponentially with each additional element in the input. An example of an
algorithm with exponential time complexity is the recursive Fibonacci
sequence algorithm.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Exponential Time Complexity}]
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Factorial Time Complexity ($O(n!)$)}

An algorithm is said to have a \textbf{\textit{factorial time complexity}} if
the execution time of the algorithm grows factorially as the input size
increases. It means that the time taken by the algorithm increases
a factorial number of times with each additional element in the input.
An example of an algorithm with factorial time complexity is the
permutation algorithm that generates all possible permutations of a
set of elements.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Factorial Time Complexity}]
void permute(string str, int l, int r) {
    if (l == r) cout << str << endl;
    else {
        for (int i = l; i <= r; i++) {
            swap(str[l], str[i]);
            permute(str, l + 1, r);
            swap(str[l], str[i]);
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Space Complexity}

The \textbf{\textit{space complexity}} of an algorithm is a measure of the amount
of memory required to execute the algorithm as a function of the input size. It
is used to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of
memory it uses. The space complexity of an algorithm is usually expressed using
big-O notation, which provides an upper bound on the amount of memory the
algorithm uses as the input size increases.

\paragraph{Constant Space Complexity ($O(1)$)}

An algorithm is said to have a \textbf{\textit{constant space complexity}} if
the amount of memory required to execute the algorithm does not depend on the
input size. It means that the algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory to
process the input. An example of an algorithm with constant space complexity
is swapping two variables without using a temporary variable.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Constant Space Complexity}]
void swap(int &a, int &b) {
    a = a + b;
    b = a - b;
    a = a - b;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Linear Space Complexity ($O(n)$)}

An algorithm is said to have a \textbf{\textit{linear space complexity}} if the
amount of memory required to execute the algorithm grows linearly as the input
size increases. It means that the algorithm uses a memory space that is
proportional to the input size. An example of an algorithm with linear space
complexity is storing the elements of an array in a separate array in reverse
order.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Linear Space Complexity}]
void reverseArray(int arr[], int n) {
    int start = 0, end = n - 1;
    while (start < end) {
        int temp = arr[start];
        arr[start] = arr[end];
        arr[end] = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Quadratic Space Complexity ($O(n^2)$)}

An algorithm is said to have a \textbf{\textit{quadratic space complexity}} if
the amount of memory required to execute the algorithm grows quadratically as
the input size increases. It means that the algorithm uses a memory space that
is proportional to the square of the input size. An example of an algorithm
with quadratic space complexity is storing all pairs of elements in an array
in a separate array.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Quadratic Space Complexity}]
void allPairs(int arr[], int n) {
    vector<int> pairs(n * n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            pairs[i * n + j] = arr[i] + arr[j];
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Exponential Space Complexity ($O(2^n)$)}

An algorithm is said to have an \textbf{\textit{exponential space complexity}}
if the amount of memory required to execute the algorithm grows exponentially
as the input size increases. An example of an algorithm with exponential space
complexity is generating all subsets of a set of elements.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Exponential Space Complexity}]
void generateSubsets(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i & (1 << j)) cout << arr[j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Factorial Space Complexity ($O(n!)$)}

An algorithm is said to have a \textbf{\textit{factorial space complexity}} if
the amount of memory required to execute the algorithm grows factorially as
the input size increases. An example of an algorithm with factorial space
complexity is generating all permutations of a set of elements.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Factorial Space Complexity}]
void permute(string str, int l, int r) {
    if (l == r) cout << str << endl;
    else {
        for (int i = l; i <= r; i++) {
            swap(str[l], str[i]);
            permute(str, l + 1, r);
            swap(str[l], str[i]);
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Arrays and Linked Lists}

\section{Introduction}

Some of the most basic and fundamental data structures in computer science
are arrays and linked lists. These data structures are used to store and
manipulate collections of elements in a computer program. In this chapter,
we will discuss the properties, operations, and complexity analysis of
arrays and linked lists.

\section{Arrays}

An \textbf{\textit{array}} is a collection of elements of the same data type
that are stored in contiguous memory locations. It is used to store multiple
values of the same type under a single name. The elements of an array can be
accessed using an index value. In C++, arrays are zero-indexed, which means
the first element is at index 0. Arrays also have a fixed size that is
specified at the time of declaration.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./assets/images/cpp-array-declaration_0.png}
    \caption{Elements of an array in C++}
    \floatfoot{Elements of an array in C++ from Programiz}
    \label{fig:array-elements}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:array-elements} shows the the visual representation of the
elements of an array in C++. It shows the array members and indices.

% Code example for array declaration
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Array Declaration}]
// array.cpp
int main() {
    int arr[6];
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The above code snippet declares an array named \texttt{arr} of size 6 that
can store 6 integer values. The elements of the array are accessed using
index values from 0 to 5 as shown in Figure \ref{fig:array-elements}.

% Code for assigning values to array elements
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Assigning Values to Array Elements}]
// array_assign.cpp
int main() {
    int arr[6];
    arr[0] = 19;
    arr[1] = 10;
    arr[2] = 8;
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The above code snippet assigns values to the elements of the array \texttt{arr}
at index 0, 1, and 2. The elements of the array can be accessed and modified
using their index values. Array elements that are not explicitly initialized
are assigned default values based on their data type. For example, integer
elements are initialized to 0.

% Insert image for array initialization
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./assets/images/cpp-array-initialization_0.png}
  \caption{Initializing Array Elements}
    \floatfoot{Initializing Array Elements from Programiz}
    \label{fig:array-initialization}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:array-initialization} shows the code for initializing array
elements in C++. The array elements are initialized using curly braces
\texttt{\{\}} with the values separated by commas. When the size of the array
is specified, the number of elements in the initialization list must match
the size of the array. If the size of the array is not specified, the size
is automatically determined based on the number of elements in the array
during initialization.

% Code for initializing array elements
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Initializing Array Elements}]
int main() {
    int arr[6] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9, 15};
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The above code snippet initializes the elements of the array \texttt{arr} with
the values 19, 10, 8, 17, 9, and 15. The size of the array is specified as 6,
and the number of elements in the initialization list matches the size of the
array.

% Another code example for array initialization with unspecified size
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Initializing Array Elements with Unspecified Size}]
int main() {
    int arr[] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9, 15};
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The above code snippet initializes the elements of the array \texttt{arr} with
the values 19, 10, 8, 17, 9, and 15. The size of the array is not specified
and is automatically determined based on the number of elements in the
initialization list.

% Figure for array initialization with empty members
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./assets/images/cpp-array-initialization_0.png}
  \caption{Initializing Array Elements with Empty Members}
    \floatfoot{Initializing Array Elements with Empty Members from Programiz}
    \label{fig:array-initialization-empty}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:array-initialization-empty} shows the code for initializing
array elements with empty members in C++. The array elements are initialized
using curly braces \texttt{\{\}} with empty members. Empty members only
appear at the end of the initialization list and are assigned default values
based on their data type. For example, integer elements are initialized to 0.

% Code for initializing array elements with empty members
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Initializing Array Elements with Empty Members}]
int main() {
    int arr[6] = {19, 10, 8};
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The above code snippet initializes the first three elements of the array
\texttt{arr} with the values 19, 10, and 8. The remaining elements of the
array are initialized to 0, which is the default value for integer elements.

\subsection{Types of Arrays}

There are two main types of arrays in C++: one-dimensional arrays and
multi-dimensional arrays.

\subsubsection{One-dimensional Array}

A \textbf{\textit{one-dimensional array}} is a collection of elements of the
same data type that are stored in a single row. It is the most common type
of array used in computer programming. The elements of a one-dimensional array
are accessed using a single index value.

% Figure for one-dimensional array
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./assets/images/Arrays-in-C.png}
  \caption{One-dimensional Array in C++}
    \floatfoot{One-dimensional Array in C++ from GeekforGeeks}
    \label{fig:one-dimensional-array}
\end{figure} 

Figure \ref{fig:one-dimensional-array} shows the visual representation of a
one-dimensional array in C++. As shown in the figure, the elements of the
array are stored in a single row, and each element is accessed using a single
index value.

% Code example for one-dimensional array
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={One-dimensional Array}]
int main() {
    int arr[6] = {2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18};
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The above code snippet declares and initializes a one-dimensional array named
\texttt{arr} with 6 integer elements. A one-dimensional array only has one
set of square brackets \texttt{[]}. One set of square brackets signifies that
the array is one-dimensional.

\subsubsection{Multi-dimensional Array}

A \textbf{\textit{multi-dimensional array}} is a collection of elements of the
same data type that are stored in multiple rows and columns. It is used to
store data in a tabular format. The elements of a multi-dimensional array are
accessed using multiple index values.

% Figure for two-dimensional array

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./assets/images/two-d.png}
  \caption{Two-dimensional Array in C++}
    \floatfoot{Two-dimensional Array in C++ from GeekforGeeks}
    \label{fig:two-dimensional-array}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:two-dimensional-array} shows the visual representation of a
two-dimensional array in C++. As shown in the figure, the elements of the
array are stored in multiple rows and columns, and each element is accessed
using two index values. The number of elements in a two-dimensional array is
determined by the number of rows and columns.

% Code example for two-dimensional array
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Two-dimensional Array}]
int main() {
    int arr[3][4] = {
        {1, 2, 3, 4},
        {5, 6, 7, 8},
        {9, 10, 11, 12}
    };
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The above code snippet declares and initializes a two-dimensional array named
\texttt{arr} with 3 rows and 3 columns. A two-dimensional array has two sets
of square brackets \texttt{[][]}. Two sets of square brackets signify that the
array is two-dimensional. The number of rows and columns in a two-dimensional
array is specified within the square brackets. The first set of square brackets
specifies the number of rows, and the second set of square brackets specifies
the number of columns. Thus, in the above example, the array \texttt{arr} has
3 rows and 4 columns.

% Code With empty members
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Two-dimensional Array with Empty Members}]
int main() {
    int arr[3][4] = {
        {1, 2},
        {5, 6, 7},
        {9}
    };
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The above code snippet initializes the elements of the two-dimensional array
\texttt{arr} with empty members. The first row of the array has 2 elements,
the second row has 3 elements, and the third row has 1 element. The remaining
elements of the array are initialized to 0, which is the default value for
integer elements.

\subsection{Array Operations}

Arrays support various operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching
of elements. These operations are essential for manipulating the elements of
an array and performing various tasks in a computer program.

\subsubsection{Insertion}

The \textbf{\textit{insertion}} operation is used to add an element to an array
at a specific position. The element is inserted at the specified index, and
the existing elements are shifted to accommodate the new element.

% TikZ diagram for array insertion
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        % Make a one dimensional grid with 6 elements
        \draw (0, 0) grid (6, 1);
        % Fill the grid with the elements
        \foreach \x/\y in {
            0/19, 1/10, 2/8, 3/17, 4/9, 5/15
        }
        \node at (\x + 0.5, 0.5) {\y};
        \node at (-2, 0.5) {Before Insertion};

        % Insert a new element at index 2
        \draw (2, -1) rectangle (3, -2);
        \node at (2.5, -1.5) {12};

        % Draw Arrow with label "Insert"
        \draw[->] (2.5, -2) -- (2.5, -3);
        \node at (4.5, -2.5) {Insert 12 at index 2};
        
        % Create a new grid with the inserted element
        \draw (0, -4) grid (7, -3);
        % Color the grid with inserted element
        \draw[fill=blue] (2, -4) rectangle (3, -3);

        \foreach \x/\y in {
            0/19, 1/10, 2/12, 3/8, 4/17, 5/9, 6/15
        }
        \node at (\x + 0.5, -3.5) {\y};
        \node at (-2, -3.5) {After Insertion};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Array Insertion}
    \label{fig:array-insertion}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:array-insertion} shows the visual representation of the
insertion operation in an array. The element 12 is inserted at index 2 of
the array, and the existing elements are shifted to accommodate the new
element.

% Code example for array insertion
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Array Insertion}, label={lst:array-insertion}]
int main() {
    int arr[100] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9, 15};
    int n = 6;
    int index = 2;
    int value = 12;

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= index; i--) {
        arr[i + 1] = arr[i];
    }
    arr[index] = value;
    n++;

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:array-insertion} shows the code for inserting an element
into an array in C++. The code snippet declares an array \texttt{arr} of size
100 and initializes it with 6 elements. It then inserts the element 12 at
index 2 of the array and shifts the existing elements to accommodate the new
element.

\subsubsection{Deletion}

The \textbf{\textit{deletion}} operation is used to remove an element from an
array at a specific position. The element is deleted from the specified index,
and the remaining elements are shifted to fill the gap created by the deletion.

% TikZ diagram for array deletion
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        % Make a one dimensional grid with 6 elements
        \draw (0, 0) grid (6, 1);
        % Fill the grid with the elements
        \foreach \x/\y in {
            0/19, 1/10, 2/8, 3/17, 4/9, 5/15
        }
        \node at (\x + 0.5, 0.5) {\y};
        \node at (-2, 0.5) {Before Deletion};

        % Delete the element at index 2
        \draw[fill=red] (2, -1) rectangle (3, -2);
        \node at (2.5, -1.5) {8};

        % Draw Arrow with label "Delete"
        \draw[->] (2.5, -3) -- (2.5, -2);
        \node at (4.75, -2.5) {Delete element at index 2};
        
        % Create a new grid with the deleted element
        \draw (0, -4) grid (5, -3);

        \foreach \x/\y in {
            0/19, 1/10, 2/17, 3/9, 4/15
        }
        \node at (\x + 0.5, -3.5) {\y};
        \node at (-2, -3.5) {After Deletion};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Array Deletion}
    \label{fig:array-deletion}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:array-deletion} shows the visual representation of the deletion
operation in an array. The element 8 is deleted from index 2 of the array, and
the remaining elements are shifted to fill the gap created by the deletion.

% Code example for array deletion
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Array Deletion}, label={lst:array-deletion}]
int main() {
    int arr[100] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9, 15};
    int n = 6;
    int index = 2;

    for (int i = index; i < n - 1; i++) {
        arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
    }
    n--;

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:array-deletion} shows the code for deleting an element from an
array in C++. The code snippet declares an array \texttt{arr} of size 100 and
initializes it with 6 elements. It then deletes the element at index 2 of the
array and shifts the remaining elements to fill the gap created by the deletion.

\subsubsection{Searching}

The \textbf{\textit{searching}} operation is used to find the position of an
element in an array. The element is searched for in the array, and the index
of the element is returned if it is found. If the element is not found, a
special value such as -1 is returned to indicate that the element is not
present in the array.

% TikZ diagram for array searching
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        % Make a one dimensional grid with 6 elements
        \draw (0, 0) grid (6, 1);
        % Fill the grid with the elements
        \foreach \x/\y in {
            0/19, 1/10, 2/8, 3/17, 4/9, 5/15
        }
        \node at (\x + 0.5, 0.5) {\y};
        \node at (-2, 0.5) {Array};

        % Search for the element 17
        \draw[fill=green] (3, -1) rectangle (4, -2);
        \node at (3.5, -1.5) {17};

        % Draw Arrow with label "Search"
        \draw[->] (3.5, -3) -- (3.5, -2);
        \node at (4.75, -2.5) {Search for 17};
        \node at (5.75, -1.5) {17 found at index 3};

        % Create a new grid with the searched element
        \draw (0, -4) grid (6, -3);

        \foreach \x/\y in {
            0/19, 1/10, 2/8, 3/17, 4/9, 5/15
        }
        \node at (\x + 0.5, -3.5) {\y};
        \node at (-2, -3.5) {Result: Index 3};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Array Searching}
    \label{fig:array-searching}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:array-searching} shows the visual representation of the
searching operation in an array. The element 17 is searched for in the array,
and the index of the element is returned if it is found. In this case, the
element 17 is found at index 3 of the array.

% Code example for array searching
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Array Searching}, label={lst:array-searching}]
int main() {
    int arr[100] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9, 15};
    int n = 6;
    int value = 17;
    int index = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == value) {
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:array-searching} shows the code for searching an element in an
array in C++. The code snippet declares an array \texttt{arr} of size 100 and
initializes it with 6 elements. It then searches for the element 17 in the
array and returns the index of the element if it is found. In this case, the
element 17 is found at index 3 of the array. The searching algorithm used in
the example is a linear search algorithm.

% \subsection{Complexity Analysis of Arrays}

\section{Linked Lists}

A \textbf{\textit{linked list}} is a data structure that consists of a sequence
of elements called nodes. A node contains a data part and a reference part that
points to the next or previous node in the sequence. Linked lists are used to
store and manipulate collections of elements in a computer program. Unlike
arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory locations, and the size
of a linked list can grow or shrink dynamically.

\subsection{Types of Linked Lists}

\subsubsection{Singly Linked List}

A \textbf{\textit{singly linked list}} is a type of linked list in which each
node contains a data part and a next part that points to the next node in the
sequence. The last node in the list points to a special value called NULL to
indicate the end of the list.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:singly-linked-list} shows the visual representation of a singly
linked list. The linked list contains nodes with data values 19, 10, 8, 17, 9,
and 15. Each node points to the next node in the sequence, and the last node
points to NULL to indicate the end of the list.

% Code example for singly linked list

    second->next = third;
    third->next = fourth;
    fourth->next = fifth;
    fifth->next = sixth;

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:singly-linked-list} shows the code for creating a singly linked
list in C++. The code snippet defines a structure \texttt{Node} that contains
a data part and a next part that points to the next node in the sequence. It
then creates a linked list with nodes containing data values 19, 10, 8, 17, 9,
and 15. Each node points to the next node in the sequence, and the last node
points to NULL to indicate the end of the list.

\subsubsection{Doubly Linked List}

A \textbf{\textit{doubly linked list}} is a type of linked list in which each
node contains a data part, a next part that points to the next node in the
sequence, and a previous part that points to the previous node in the sequence.
The first node in the list points to NULL in the previous part, and the last
node in the list points to NULL in the next part.

\subsubsection{Circular Linked List}

A \textbf{\textit{circular linked list}} is a type of linked list in which the
last node in the list points back to the first node, forming a circular loop.
This allows traversal of the list in a circular manner, starting from any node
in the list.

Figure \ref{fig:circular-linked-list} shows the visual representation of a
circular linked list. The linked list contains nodes with data values 19, 10,
8, 17, 9, and 15. Each node points to the next node in the sequence, and the
last node points back to the first node, forming a circular loop.

\subsubsection{Doubly Circular Linked List}

A \textbf{\textit{doubly circular linked list}} is a type of linked list in
which each node contains a data part, a next part that points to the next node
in the sequence, and a previous part that points to the previous node in the
sequence. The first node in the list points to the last node in the previous
part, and the last node in the list points to the first node in the next part,
forming a circular loop.

% \subsection{Complexity Analysis of Linked Lists}

\section{Comparison of Arrays and Linked Lists}

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and can grow dynamically
by adding new nodes. This makes linked lists more flexible and efficient for
insertion and deletion operations, as they do not require shifting elements to
accommodate new elements. However, linked lists have higher memory overhead due
to the additional pointers in each node.

Arrays are more efficient for random access operations, as elements can be
accessed directly using their index. In contrast, linked lists require
traversing the list from the head node to the desired node, which can be slower
for large lists. Arrays also have better cache locality, as elements are stored
contiguously in memory, leading to faster access times.

Thus, if the application requires frequent insertion and deletion operations
with a dynamic size, linked lists are a better choice. On the other hand, if the
application requires frequent random access operations and has a fixed size,
arrays are more suitable.

\section{Summary}

In this chapter, we discussed arrays and linked lists as fundamental data
structures in computer science. We covered the basic concepts, operations, and
implementations of arrays and linked lists, along with their comparison in terms
of performance and memory usage. We also explored different types of linked
lists, such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists,
and doubly circular linked lists, and discussed the operations on linked lists,
such as insertion, deletion, and searching. Finally, we compared arrays and
linked lists based on their characteristics and use cases.

\chapter{Stacks and Queues}

\section{Introduction}

`Stack' and `Queue' are two fundamental data structures in computer
science that are used to store and manage data in a specific order.
They are widely used in various applications, such as operating systems,
compilers, and network protocols, to manage data efficiently.

\section{Stack}

A `Stack' is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out
(LIFO) principle, where the last element inserted is the first one to be
removed. The operations on a stack are `Push' (to insert an element),
`Pop' (to remove an element), `Top' (to get the top element), `Size'
(to get the number of elements), and `Empty' (to check if the stack is
empty).

% Draw a stack data structure using TikZ

Figure \ref{fig:stack-data-structure} shows the visual representation of a
stack data structure. The stack contains elements 19, 10, 8, 17, 9, and 15,
where 15 is the top element of the stack.

\subsection{Operations on Stack}

\subsubsection{Push}

The `Push' operation is used to insert an element into the stack. The new
element is added to the top of the stack.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Stack Push Operation}, label={lst:stack-push-operation}]
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    stack<int> s;

    s.push(19);
    s.push(10);
    s.push(8);
    s.push(17);
    s.push(9);
    s.push(15);

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:stack-push-operation} shows the code for the `Push' operation on
a stack in C++. The code snippet creates a stack using the \texttt{stack} class
from the Standard Template Library (STL) and pushes elements 19, 10, 8, 17, 9,
and 15 onto the stack. To `push' an element onto the stack, the \texttt{push()}
method is called with the element to be inserted as an argument.

\subsubsection{Pop}

The `Pop' operation is used to remove the top element from the stack. The
element is removed from the top of the stack, and the stack is adjusted
accordingly.

% \subsection{Complexity Analysis of Stack}

% The time complexity of the `Push', `Pop', `Top', `Size', and `Empty' operations
% on a stack is $O(1)$, as they involve only a single operation to insert, remove,
% get the top element, get the size, and check if the stack is empty, respectively.
% The space complexity of a stack is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in
% the stack, as it requires memory to store the elements.

\section{Queue}

A `Queue' is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out
(FIFO) principle, where the first element inserted is the first one to be
removed. The operations on a queue are `Push' (to insert an element),
`Pop' (to remove an element), `Front' (to get the front element),
`Back' (to get the back element), `Size' (to get the number of elements),
and `Empty' (to check if the queue is empty).

% One particular application of a queue is in the scheduling of processes in
% an operating system. The processes are added to the queue in the order they
% arrive and are executed in the same order.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:queue-push-operation} shows the visual representation of the
`Push' operation on a queue. The queue is initially empty, and elements 19, 10,
8, 17, 9, and 15 are pushed into the queue one by one.

% Code example for queue push operation
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Queue Push Operation}, label={lst:queue-push-operation}]
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    queue<int> q;

    q.push(19);
    q.push(10);
    q.push(8);
    q.push(17);
    q.push(9);
    q.push(15);

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:queue-push-operation} shows the code for the `Push' operation on
a queue in C++. The code snippet creates a queue using the \texttt{queue} class
from the Standard Template Library (STL) and pushes elements 19, 10, 8, 17, 9,
and 15 into the queue. To `push' an element into the queue, the \texttt{push()}
method is called with the element to be inserted as an argument.

\subsubsection{Pop}

The `Pop' operation is used to remove the front element from the queue. The
element is removed from the front of the queue, and the queue is adjusted
accordingly.

% \subsection{Complexity Analysis of Queue}

% The time complexity of the `Push', `Pop', `Front', `Back', `Size', and `Empty'
% operations on a queue is $O(1)$. The space complexity of a queue is $O(n)$, where
% $n$ is the number of elements in the queue.

% \subsection{Implementation of Queue Using Arrays}

% \subsection{Implementation of Queue Using Linked Lists}

\section{Comparison of Stack and Queue}

The key differences between a `Stack' and a `Queue' is that a stack follows the
Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, while a queue follows the First In First Out
(FIFO) principle. You can visualize a stack as a stack of plates, where the last
plate added is the first one to be removed. On the other hand, you can visualize
a queue as a line of people waiting for a bus, where the first person in line is
the first one to board the bus.

In `stack' you can only access the top element, while in `queue' you can access
both the front and back elements. In `stack' you can only push and pop elements
at the top, while in `queue' you can push elements at the back and pop elements
from the front. The time complexity of the `push', `pop', `front', `back', `size',
and `empty' operations is the same for both stack and queue. Both also have the
same space complexity. In `stack' you can only access the top element while in
`queue' you can access both the front and back elements.

\section{Summary}

In this chapter, we discussed the `Queue' data structure. A queue is a linear
data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. We learned
about the basic operations on a queue, such as `Push', `Pop', `Front', `Back',
`Size', and `Empty'. We also compared the `Stack' and `Queue' data structures.

\chapter{Introduction to Algorithms}

\section{Introduction}

Algorithms are a fundamental concept in computer science and play a crucial role
in solving computational problems efficiently. An algorithm is a step-by-step
procedure or a set of rules to solve a specific problem. It is a sequence of
instructions that takes an input, performs some computation, and produces an
output. Algorithms are used in various applications, such as search engines,
social media platforms, e-commerce websites, navigation systems, and many more.

\section{How do Algorithms Work?}

Algorithms work by taking an input, processing it through a series of steps, and
producing an output. The input to an algorithm can be any data, such as numbers,
strings, arrays, graphs, or any other data structure. The algorithm processes
the input data using a set of rules or instructions to perform a specific task.
The output of the algorithm is the result obtained after processing the input
data. The output can be a single value, a set of values, or any other form of
data, depending on the problem being solved.

algorithm takes an input, processes it using an algorithm, and produces an output.

\section{Characteristics of an Algorithm}

An algorithm has the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clear and Unambiguous}: The algorithm should be
    unambiguous. Each of its steps should be clear in all aspects
    and must lead to only one meaning.
    
    \item \textbf{Well-defined Inputs}: If an algorithm says to take
    inputs, it should be well-defined inputs. It may or may not take
    input.

    \item \textbf{Well-defined Outputs}: The algorithm must clearly
    define what output will be yielded and it should be well-defined
    as well. It should produce at least 1 output.

    \item \textbf{Finiteness}: The algorithm must be finite, i.e. it
    should terminate after a finite time.

    \item \textbf{Feasible}: The algorithm must be simple, generic,
    and practical, such that it can be executed using reasonable
    constraints and resources.

    \item \textbf{Language Independent}: Algorithm must be
    language-independent, i.e. it must be just plain instructions
    that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will
    be the same, as expected.
\end{itemize}

\section{What is the Need for Algorithms?}

Algorithms are essential for solving complex computational problems efficiently
and effectively. They can be used to solve a wide range of problems, such as
searching, sorting, optimization, and many more. They provide a systematic
approach to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Solving Problems}: Algorithms break down problems into smaller,
    manageable steps, making it easier to solve complex problems.

    \item \textbf{Optimizing Solutions}: Algorithms find the best or near-optimal
    solutions to problems, helping to optimize the performance of systems.

    \item \textbf{Automating Tasks}: Algorithms can automate repetitive or complex
    tasks, saving time and effort in performing these tasks manually.
\end{itemize}

\section{Types of Algorithms}

There are various types of algorithms based on their design and functionality.
Some common types of algorithms include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Brute Force Algorithm}: It is the simplest approach
    to a problem. A brute force algorithm is the first approach that
    comes to finding when we see a problem.

    \item \textbf{Recursive Algorithm}: A recursive algorithm is
    based on recursion. In this case, a problem is broken into several
    sub-parts and called the same function again and again.

    \item \textbf{Backtracking}: The backtracking algorithm builds the 
    solution by searching among all possible solutions. Using this 
    algorithm, we keep on building the solution following criteria. 
    Whenever a solution fails, we trace back to the failure point build 
    on the next solution and continue this process till we find the 
    solution or all possible solutions are looked after.

    \item \textbf{Searching Algorithm}: Searching algorithms are the
    ones that are used for searching elements or groups of elements 
    from a particular data structure. They can be of different types 
    based on their approach or the data structure in which the 
    element should be found.

    \item \textbf{Sorting Algorithm}: Sorting is arranging a group 
    of data in a particular manner according to the requirement. The 
    algorithms which help in performing this function are called 
    sorting algorithms. Generally sorting algorithms are used to sort 
    groups of data in an increasing or decreasing manner.

    \item \textbf{Hashing Algorithm}: Hashing algorithms work 
    similarly to the searching algorithm. But they contain an index 
    with a key ID. In hashing, a key is assigned to specific data.

    \item \textbf{Divide and Conquer Algorithm}: This algorithm 
    breaks a problem into sub-problems, solves a single sub-problem, 
    and merges the solutions to get the final solution. It consists 
    of the following three steps: Divide, Solve, and Combine.

    \item \textbf{Greedy Algorithm}: In this type of algorithm, the 
    solution is built part by part. The solution for the next part 
    is built based on the immediate benefit of the next part. The 
    one solution that gives the most benefit will be chosen as the 
    solution for the next part.

    \item \textbf{Dynamic Programming Algorithm}: This algorithm 
    uses the concept of using the already found solution to avoid 
    repetitive calculation of the same part of the problem. It 
    divides the problem into smaller overlapping sub-problems and 
    solves them.

    \item \textbf{Randomized Algorithm}: In the randomized algorithm, 
    we use a random number so it gives immediate benefit. The random 
    number helps in deciding the expected outcome.
\end{itemize}

\section{Examples of Algorithms}

Below are some examples of algorithms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sorting Algorithms}: Merge sort, Quick sort, Heap sort
    \item \textbf{Searching Algorithms}: Linear search, Binary search, Hashing
    \item \textbf{Graph Algorithms}: Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, Floyd-Warshall algorithm
    \item \textbf{String Matching Algorithms}: Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, Boyer-Moore algorithm
\end{itemize}

\section{How to Write an Algorithm?}

To write an algorithm, follow these steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Define the problem}: Clearly state the problem to be 
    solved.
    
    \item \textbf{Design the algorithm}: Choose an appropriate 
    algorithm design paradigm and develop a step-by-step procedure.
    
    \item \textbf{Implement the algorithm}: Translate the algorithm 
    into a programming language.
    
    \item \textbf{Test and debug}: Execute the algorithm with various
    inputs to ensure its correctness and efficiency.

    \item \textbf{Analyze the algorithm}: Determine its time and space
    complexity and compare it to alternative algorithms.
\end{itemize}

\section{How to Design an Algorithm?}

To write an algorithm, the following things are needed as a 
pre-requisite:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The problem that is to be solved by this algorithm i.e.
    clear problem definition.

    \item The constraints of the problem must be considered while 
    solving the problem.

    \item The input to be taken to solve the problem.

    \item The output to be expected when the problem is solved.
    
    \item The solution to this problem within the given constraints.
\end{enumerate}

Then the algorithm is written with the help of the above parameters 
such that it solves the problem.

\subsection{Example}

Consider the example to add three numbers and print the sum.

\subsubsection{Step 1: Fulfilling the pre-requisites}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The problem that is to be solved by this algorithm: Add 3 
    numbers and print their sum.

    \item The constraints of the problem that must be considered 
    while solving the problem: The numbers must contain only digits 
    and no other characters.

    \item The input to be taken to solve the problem: The three 
    numbers to be added.

    \item The output to be expected when the problem is solved: 
    The sum of the three numbers taken as the input i.e. a single 
    integer value.

    \item The solution to this problem, in the given constraints: 
    The solution consists of adding the 3 numbers. It can be done 
    with the help of the ‘+’ operator, or bit-wise, or any other 
    method.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Step 2: Designing the Algorithm (Pseudo-code)}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item START
    \item Declare 3 integer variables num1, num2, and num3.
    \item Take the three numbers, to be added, as inputs in variables 
    num1, num2, and num3 respectively.
    \item Declare an integer variable sum to store the resultant sum 
    of the 3 numbers.
    \item Add the 3 numbers and store the result in the variable sum.
    \item Print the value of the variable sum
    \item END
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Step 3: Testing the Algorithm}

% Code example for adding three numbers using C++
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Adding Three Numbers}, label={lst:adding-three-numbers}]
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1, num2, num3;

    int sum;

    cout << "Enter 1st number: ";
    cin >> num1;
    cout << " " << num1 << endl;

    cout << "Enter 2nd number: ";
    cin >> num2;
    cout << " " << num2 << endl;

    cout << "Enter 3rd number: ";
    cin >> num3;
    cout << " " << num3 << endl;

    sum = num1 + num2 + num3;

    cout << "Sum of the three numbers: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Problem 1:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input: num1 = 10, num2 = 20, num3 = 30
    \item Output: sum = 60
\end{itemize}

Problem 2:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input: num1 = 5, num2 = 15, num3 = 25
    \item Output: sum = 45
\end{itemize}

Code \ref{lst:adding-three-numbers} shows the code for adding 
three numbers in C++. The code snippet takes three numbers as
input from the user, adds them, and prints the sum. Here's the
step-by-step algorithm of the code:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Declare 3 integer variables ``num1'', ``num2'', and ``num3'' to store
    the three numbers to be added.

    \item Declare an integer variable ``sum'' to store the sum of the
    three numbers.

    \item Take the three numbers as input from the user and store
    them in the variables ``num1'', ``num2'', and ``num3''.

    \item Add the three numbers and store the result in the variable
    ``sum''.

    \item Print the sum of the three numbers.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Searching Algorithms}

\section{Introduction}

Searching is the process of finding a specific element in a collection of
elements. Searching algorithms are used to search for an element in a data
structure, such as an array, list, tree, or graph. There are various searching
algorithms, each with its own approach and complexity. Searching algorithms
play a crucial role in various applications, such as search engines, databases,
and information retrieval systems.

\section{Importance of Searching Algorithms}

Searching algorithms are essential for finding specific information in a large
collection of data. They help in quickly locating the desired element without
the need to scan the entire data structure. Searching algorithms are used in
various applications, such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Search Engines}: Search engines use searching algorithms to
    retrieve relevant information from the web.

    \item \textbf{Databases}: Databases use searching algorithms to search for
    specific records or data.

    \item \textbf{Information Retrieval Systems}: Information retrieval systems
    use searching algorithms to retrieve relevant information from a large
    collection of documents.

    \item \textbf{E-commerce Websites}: E-commerce websites use searching
    algorithms to search for products based on user queries.

    \item \textbf{Social Media Platforms}: Social media platforms use searching
    algorithms to search for users, posts, or content.

    \item \textbf{Navigation Systems}: Navigation systems use searching algorithms
    to find the shortest path or route between two locations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Characteristics of Searching Algorithms}

Understanding the characteristics of searching in data structures 
and algorithms is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and 
making informed decisions about which searching technique to employ. 
Here, we explore key aspects and characteristics associated with 
searching:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target Element}: In searching, there is always a 
    specific target element or item that you want to find within the 
    data collection. This target could be a value, a record, a key, 
    or any other data entity of interest.

    \item \textbf{Search Space}: The search space refers to the entire 
    collection of data within which you are looking for the target 
    element. Depending on the data structure used, the search space 
    may vary in size and organization.

    \item \textbf{Search Order}: The search order determines the
    sequence in which elements are examined during the search process.
    The order can be linear, binary, or any other specific pattern
    based on the algorithm used.

    \item \textbf{Search Result}: The search result is the outcome of
    the search process. It indicates whether the target element was
    found or not, and may include additional information such as the
    location of the element in the data structure.

    \item \textbf{Complexity}: Searching can have different levels of 
    complexity depending on the data structure and the algorithm used. 
    The complexity is often measured in terms of time and space 
    requirements.

\end{itemize} 

\section{Types of Searching Algorithms}

There are several types of searching algorithms, each with its own approach
and complexity. These searching algorithms have advantages and disadvantages
based on the type of data structure and the size of the data. Deter

\subsection{Linear Search}

Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that searches for an element in
a collection of elements by checking each element one by one until the desired
element is found or the end of the collection is reached. It is also known as
``sequential search''.

    \caption{Linear Search}
    \label{fig:linear-search}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:linear-search} shows the linear search algorithm in action.
The algorithm searches for the element 30 in an array of elements. It checks
each element one by one until it finds the desired element or reaches the end
of the array. In this case, the element 30 is found at index 2.

\subsubsection{Algorithm of Linear Search}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Algorithm examines each element, one by one, in the 
    collection, treating each element as a potential match for the key 
    you’re searching for.

    \item The Algorithm examines each element, one by one, in the
    collection, treating each element as a potential match for the key
    you’re searching for.

    \item If it goes through all the elements and none of them matches
    the key, then that means “No match is Found”.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pseudo-code of Linear Search}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Linear Search Pseudo-code}]
LinearSearch(arr, key)
    for i = 0 to arr.length - 1
        if arr[i] == key
            return i
    return -1
\end{lstlisting}

Pseudo-code for Linear Search is shown in the code snippet. The algorithm
takes an array and a key as input and searches for the key in the array.
If the key is found, it returns the index of the key in the array; otherwise,
it returns -1.

\subsubsection{Linear Search in C++}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Linear Search in C++}, label={lst:linear-search-cpp}]
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int linearSearch(vector<int> &arr, int key) {
    int n = arr.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == key) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {10, 50, 30, 70, 80, 60, 20, 90, 40};
    int key = 30;

    int index = linearSearch(arr, key);

    if (index != -1) {
        cout << "Element found at index: " << index << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Element not found" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:linear-search-cpp} shows the implementation of the linear 
search algorithm in C++. The code snippet defines a function 
\texttt{linearSearch} that takes a vector of integers and a key as input
and searches for the key in the vector. If the key is found, it returns
the index of the key in the vector; otherwise, it returns -1. In the
example, the linear search algorithm is used to search for the element
30 in an array of elements. And the element is found at index 2.

\subsubsection{Application of Linear Search}

Linear search can be used in various applications, such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unsorted Lists}: Linear search is suitable for
    searching in unsorted lists where the elements are not in any
    particular order.

    \item \textbf{Small Data Sets}: Linear search is efficient for
    small data sets where the overhead of sorting the data is not
    justified.

    \item \textbf{Linear Data Structures}: Linear search is commonly
    used in linear data structures like arrays and linked lists as
    it traverses the elements sequentially.

    \item \textbf{Simple Search Operations}: Linear search is useful
    for simple search operations where the data is not too large and
    the search is infrequent.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Advantages and Disadvantages of Linear Search}

\textbf{Advantages}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Suitable for small data sets.
    \item Works well for unsorted lists.
    \item Does not require any additional memory.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Inefficient for large data sets as it has a time complexity
    of O(n) in the worst case.
    \item Not suitable for sorted lists.
    \item Slower than other searching algorithms like binary search.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Complexity Analysis of Linear Search}

The time complexity of linear search is \texttt{O(n)}, where \texttt{n}
is the number of elements in the collection. In the worst-case scenario,
the algorithm may have to examine all elements in the collection to find
the desired element. The space complexity of linear search is \texttt{O(1)},
as it does not require any additional memory.

\subsection{Binary Search}

Binary search is a searching algorithm that finds the position of a target
value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element
of the array and eliminates half of the remaining elements each time. Binary
search is more efficient than linear search for large data sets.

    \caption{Binary Search}
    \label{fig:binary-search}    
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:binary-search} shows the binary search algorithm in 
action. The algorithm searches for the element 23 in a sorted array
of elements. It compares the target value to the middle element of
the array and eliminates half of the remaining elements each time.
In the 1st iteration, the algorithm compares 23 with 16 and decides
to take the 2nd half since 23 > 16. In the 2nd iteration, the algorithm
compares 23 with 56 and decides to take the 1st half since 23 < 56.
In the 3rd iteration, the algorithm finds 23 at index 5 and returns
the index.

\subsubsection{Algorithm of Binary Search}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Divide the search space into two halves by finding the 
    middle index ``mid''.

    \item Compare the middle element of the search space with the key.
    
    \item Compare the middle element of the search space with the key.

    \item If the key is not found at middle element, choose which
    half will be used as the next search space.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the key is not found at middle element, choose which
        half will be used as the next search space.
        
        \item If the key is not found at middle element, choose which
        half will be used as the next search space.
    \end{itemize}

    \item If the key is not found at middle element, choose which half
    will be used as the next search space.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pseudo-code of Binary Search}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Binary Search Pseudo-code}]
BinarySearch(arr, key)
    low = 0
    high = arr.length - 1
    while low <= high
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if arr[mid] == key
            return mid
        else if arr[mid] < key
            low = mid + 1
        else
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
\end{lstlisting}

Pseudo-code for Binary Search is shown in the code snippet. The algorithm
takes a sorted array and a key as input and searches for the key in the
array using the binary search technique. If the key is found, it returns
the index of the key in the array; otherwise, it returns -1.

\subsubsection{Binary Search in C++}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Binary Search in C++}, label={lst:binary-search-cpp}]
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int binarySearch(vector<int> &arr, int key) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = arr.size() - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] == key) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < key) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91};
    int key = 23;

    int index = binarySearch(arr, key);

    if (index != -1) {
        cout << "Element found at index: " << index << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Element not found" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:binary-search-cpp} shows the implementation of the binary
search algorithm in C++. The code snippet defines a function
\texttt{binarySearch} that takes a vector of integers and a key as input
and searches for the key in the vector using the binary search technique.
If the key is found, it returns the index of the key in the vector;
otherwise, it returns -1. In the example, the binary search algorithm is
used to search for the element 23 in a sorted array of elements. And the
element is found at index 5. During the search process, the algorithm
compares the target value to the middle element of the array and eliminates
half of the remaining elements each time. If the middle element is greater
than the target value, the algorithm chooses the 1st half as the next search
space; otherwise, it chooses the 2nd half. For each iteration, the algorithm
updates the low and high indices to narrow down the search space until the
target value is found or the search space is empty. If the search space is
empty, the algorithm returns -1 to indicate that the target value is not
present in the array.

\subsubsection{Application of Binary Search}

Binary search can be used in various applications, such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Building Block}: Binary search can be used as a 
    building block for more complex algorithms used in machine 
    learning, such as algorithms for training neural networks or 
    finding the optimal hyperparameters for a model.
    
    \item \textbf{Computer Graphics}: It can be used for searching 
    in computer graphics such as algorithms for ray tracing or 
    texture mapping.
    
    \item \textbf{Database}: It can be used for searching a database.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Advantages and Disadvantages of Binary Search}

\textbf{Advantages}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item More efficient than linear search for large data sets.
    
    \item More efficient than other searching algorithms with a 
    similar time complexity, such as interpolation search or 
    exponential search.
    
    \item Binary search is well-suited for searching large datasets 
    that are stored in external memory, such as on a hard drive or 
    in the cloud.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The array should be sorted.
    \item Binary search requires that the data structure being
    searched be stored in contiguous memory locations. 
    \item Binary search requires that the elements of the array be 
    comparable, meaning that they must be able to be ordered.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Complexity Analysis of Binary Search}

The time complexity of binary search is \texttt{O(log n)}, where 
\texttt{n} is the number of elements in the collection. In each
iteration, the search space is divided in half, resulting in a
time complexity of \texttt{O(log n)}. The space complexity of
binary search is \texttt{O(1)}, as it does not require any
additional memory.

\subsection{Other Searching Algorithms}

Apart from linear search and binary search, there are several other
searching algorithms that are commonly used in practice. Some of the
popular searching algorithms are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Jump Search}: Jump search is an algorithm for finding
    the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by
    jumping ahead by fixed steps and then performing a linear search
    to find the target value.
    
    \item \textbf{Interpolation Search}: Interpolation search is an
    algorithm for finding the position of a target value within a sorted
    array. It works by estimating the position of the target value based
    on the values at the ends of the array and then performing a binary
    search to find the target value.
    
    \item \textbf{Exponential Search}: Exponential search is an algorithm
    for finding the position of a target value within a sorted array. It
    works by doubling the size of the search space until the target value
    is found, and then performing a binary search to find the target value.
    
    \item \textbf{Fibonacci Search}: Fibonacci search is an algorithm for
    finding the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works
    by dividing the search space into two parts using the Fibonacci numbers
    and then performing a binary search to find the target value.
    
    \item \textbf{Hash Search}: Hash search is an algorithm for finding the
    position of a target value within a hash table. It works by using a hash
    function to map the target value to a key and then looking up the key in
    the hash table to find the target value.
\end{itemize}

disadvantages, and complexity analysis of these algorithms. Additionally,

\chapter{Sorting Algorithms}

\section{Introduction}

Imagine you have a messy pile of socks, and you want to organize them 
by color. That's exactly what a sorting algorithm does, but with data! 
Sorting algorithms are fundamental techniques used to arrange the 
elements of a data structure in a specific order, such as ascending or 
descending. These algorithms are crucial in computer science because 
they optimize the efficiency of other algorithms that require sorted 
data, like search algorithms. Whether it's Bubble Sort gently swapping 
elements  like a careful librarian, or Quick Sort slicing through data 
like a  ninja chef, these algorithms make sure everything is in the 
right  place. And the best part? Most programming languages come with 
these  sorting Algorithms built-in, so you don't have to reinvent the 
wheel  every time you need to sort something.

\section{Importance of Sorting Algorithms}

Sorting algorithms are essential in computer science and programming
as they are used to arrange data in a specific order. There is a wide 
range of applications for these algorithms, including searching 
algorithms, database algorithms, divide and conquer methods, and data 
structure algorithms. Here are some of the key reasons why sorting
algorithms are important:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Efficient Searching}: Sorting algorithms are used to
    arrange data in a specific order, making it easier and faster to
    search for elements in the data structure. For example, binary
    search requires the data to be sorted before it can be applied.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Analysis}: Sorting algorithms are used in data
    analysis to organize and analyze large datasets. By sorting the
    data, patterns and trends can be identified more easily.
    
    \item \textbf{Database Management}: Sorting algorithms are used in
    database management systems to sort records and improve the
    efficiency of queries and data retrieval.
    
    \item \textbf{Optimization}: Sorting algorithms are used in
    optimization problems to arrange elements in a specific order
    that minimizes or maximizes a certain criterion.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Structure Operations}: Sorting algorithms are
    used in various data structure operations, such as merging two
    sorted arrays, finding the median of a dataset, and removing
    duplicates from a list.

    \item \textbf{Machine Learning}: Sorting algorithms are used in
    machine learning algorithms to preprocess and organize data
    before training models. Sorting data can improve the performance
    of machine learning algorithms and make them more efficient.

    \item \textbf{Operating Systems}: Sorting algorithms are used in
    operating systems to manage and organize files and directories.
    By sorting files and directories, the user can easily locate and
    access the required information.
\end{itemize}

\section{Types of Sorting Techniques}

There are various sorting algorithms are used in data structures. 
The following two types of sorting algorithms can be broadly 
classified:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Comparison-based Sorting Algorithms}: In comparison-based
    sorting algorithms, elements are compared with each other to determine
    their relative order. The most common comparison-based sorting algorithms
    include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick
    Sort, Heap Sort, and Shell Sort.

    \item \textbf{Non-comparison-based Sorting Algorithms}: In non-comparison-based
    sorting algorithms, elements are not compared with each other directly.
    Instead, these algorithms use specific properties of the elements to
    determine their order. The most common non-comparison-based sorting

\section{Types of Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms}

There are various types of sorting algorithms used in computer science
and programming. These sorting algorithms can be broadly classified
into two categories: comparison-based sorting algorithms and
non-comparison-based sorting algorithms.

\subsection{Selection Sort}

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly
selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array
and swapping it with the first unsorted element. The algorithm divides
the array into two parts: the sorted part at the beginning and the
unsorted part at the end. In each iteration, the algorithm finds the
minimum element in the unsorted part and swaps it with the first
unsorted element. This process continues until the entire array is
sorted.

    \caption{Selection Sort}
    \label{fig:selection-sort}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:selection-sort} shows the Selection Sort algorithm in
action. The algorithm sorts an array of elements by repeatedly selecting
the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and swapping
it with the first unsorted element. In each iteration, the algorithm
finds the minimum element in the unsorted part and swaps it with the
first unsorted element. This process continues until the entire array
is sorted.

\subsubsection{Algorithm of Selection Sort}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Divide the array into two parts: the sorted part at the
    beginning and the unsorted part at the end.
    
    \item Find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array.
    
    \item Swap the minimum element with the first unsorted element.
    
    \item Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted elements until
    the entire array is sorted.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pseudo-code of Selection Sort}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Selection Sort Pseudo-code}]
SelectionSort(arr)
    n = arr.length
    for i = 0 to n-1
        minIndex = i
        for j = i+1 to n
            if arr[j] < arr[minIndex]
                minIndex = j
        swap(arr[i], arr[minIndex])
\end{lstlisting}

Pseudo-code for Selection Sort is shown in the code snippet. The algorithm
takes an array of elements as input and sorts the array using the Selection
Sort technique. The algorithm iterates through the array, finds the minimum
element in the unsorted part, and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

\subsubsection{Selection Sort in C++}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Selection Sort in C++}, label={lst:selection-sort-cpp}]
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void selectionSort(vector<int> &arr) {
    int n = arr.size();

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int minIndex = i;

        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                minIndex = j;
            }
        }

        swap(arr[i], arr[minIndex]);
    }
}

void printArray(vector<int> &arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
    
    cout << "Original Array: ";
    printArray(arr);

    selectionSort(arr);

    cout << "Sorted Array: ";
    printArray(arr);

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Code \ref{lst:selection-sort-cpp} shows the implementation of the Selection
Sort algorithm in C++. The code snippet defines a function \texttt{selectionSort}
that takes a vector of integers as input and sorts the array using the Selection
Sort technique. The algorithm iterates through the array, finds the minimum element
in the unsorted part, and swaps it with the first unsorted element. This process
continues until the entire array is sorted. In the example, the Selection Sort
algorithm is used to sort an array of elements, and the sorted array is printed
to the console.

\subsubsection{Application of Selection Sort}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Teaching}: Selection Sort is often used in computer science
    courses to teach fundamental sorting mechanisms and algorithm design.
    
    \item \textbf{Small Lists}: Selection Sort is suitable for small lists
    where the overhead of more complex algorithms isn't justified.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited Memory}: Selection Sort is ideal for systems with
    limited memory due to its in-place sorting capability.
    
    \item \textbf{Embedded Systems}: Selection Sort is used in simple embedded
    systems where resource availability is limited, and simplicity is important.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Advantages and Disadvantages of Selection Sort}

\textbf{Advantages}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Easy to understand and implement, making it ideal for teaching
    basic sorting concepts.
    
    \item Requires only a constant \texttt{$O(1)$} extra memory space.
    
    \item Requires less number of swaps (or memory writes) compared to
    many other standard algorithms. Only cycle sort beats it in terms
    of memory writes. Therefore, it can be a simple algorithm choice
    when memory writes are costly.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Selection sort has a time complexity of \texttt{$O(n^2)$} makes
    it slower compared to algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.
    
    \item Does not maintain the relative order of equal elements.
    
    \item Does not preserve the relative order of items with equal keys
    which means it is not stable.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Complexity Analysis of Selection Sort}

The time complexity of Selection Sort is \texttt{$O(n^2)$}, where
\texttt{$n$} is the number of elements in the array. The space
complexity of Selection Sort is \texttt{$O(1)$}, as it does not
require any additional memory.
