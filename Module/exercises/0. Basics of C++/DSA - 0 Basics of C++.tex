\begin{chapquote}{Bjarne Stroustrup}
``C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when
you do, it blows away your whole leg.''
\end{chapquote}

Instructions: Write a program that solves the following problems.
Submit your code to the Google Drive folder provided by the instructor.

% The following are the exercises to test out the basic concepts of C++.

\begin{enumerate}
  % Hello World!
  \item Write a program that prints the message ``Hello, World!'' to the console.
  % Simple Arithmetic
  \item Write a program that computes the sum, difference, product, quotient,
  and remainder of two numbers then prints the results to the console.
  \begin{align}
    num1 &= 10 \\
    num2 &= 4 \\
    num3 &= 3.5 \\
    num4 &= 2.5
  \end{align}
  \begin{align}
    sum &= num1 + num2 \\
    diff &= num1 - num2 \\
    prod &= num3 \times num4 \\
    quot &= num3 / num4 \\
    rem &= num1 \% num2
  \end{align}
  % Print
  Output:
  \begin{lstlisting}
    Sum: 14
    Difference: 6
    Product: 8.75
    Quotient: 1.4
    Remainder: 2
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Submission of Coding Exercises}

Instructions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Go to the Google Drive folder provided by the instructor: \\
  \begin{quote}
    \textbf{BSIT 2-4:} \\ \url{\GoogleDriveURLBSITTwoFour} \\ \\
    \textbf{BSIT 2-5:} \\ \url{\GoogleDriveURLBSITTwoFive}
  \end{quote}
  \item Inside the folder, create another folder for your group
  with the following format:
    \begin{quote}
      \textbf{\FolderFormat} \\
      Example: \textbf{\FolderFormatExample}
    \end{quote}
  \item Inside the sub-folder, create another folder with the name:
    \begin{quote}
        \textbf{Chapter \ChapterNumber - Coding Exercise \CodingNumber - \CodingTitle}
    \end{quote}
  \item Inside the folder, upload the file of your submission.
    \begin{quote}
        Fill in the template provided in the following link and upload
        it inside the folder: \\
        \url{\SubmissionTemplateURL}
    \end{quote}
  \item The activity must be submitted \textbf{\SubmissionDeadlineText}.
  \item Late submissions will not be accepted.
\end{enumerate}
